30 DAY Challenge - DAY 16

As a part of day 16 challenge in my 30 days = 30 projects challenge, I programmed a quiz app where a set of questions will be posted and the user should answer all the required questions where a scored card will be generated based on the answers. 
In future this might be updated with API and made more usable.
